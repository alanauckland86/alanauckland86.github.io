Hello, It is a pleasure to meet you!

I am Alan, and I am glad you have taken the time to find out a little about me.

Stand by for condensed life story!

I grew up in Cornwall, flunked College first time around and decided to join
the Royal Air Force (RAF). I served a wonderful 6 years as a Regiment Gunner.  
I saw active duty in 2005/06 and 2007. I served in Cyprus before coming back to
England. I was unfortunately discharged from the service with a medical
condition called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (P.T.S.D).
After leaving the service I pursued many courses to treat my P.T.S.D and have
now adapted to live with it.

I later started to look at a new career path and completed a college course in
Countryside Management, where I found I had a good aptitude for teaching others
and gained employment as a Teaching Assistant at the college.

Whilst working as a Teaching Assistant I found myself supporting students on a
level 3 I.T course. It was pretty much identical to the first college course I
attended as a 16 year old and I found myself remembering and connecting many
missing dots.

After supporting these students I was accepted onto the college's HND computing
course and completed it with Distinction.

I took a year out and worked at Secondary school as a Teaching Assistant again
where I have been helping students learn their European Computing Driving
License (ECDL) and encouraging students to get into tech by running an after
school session with the Raspberry Pie and Code Academy.  

I am now looking forward to topping up my HND to a full degree and helping to
create a non-profit business called Yet2Learn, which is going to support people
gain and build experience and portfolios to gain their first job within the I.T
sector.
