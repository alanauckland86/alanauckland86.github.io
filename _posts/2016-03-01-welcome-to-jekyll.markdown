Hi everyone,
            In September 2016, all going well, I should be embarking on a new
            chapter in my life and going to Southampton Solent University to
            top-up my Higher National Diploma (HND) to a full degree in
            computing. In preparation for this  I am creating this blog as a
            means of keeping a journal of my studies, as well as a means to
            learn some new skills.
            I have used GitHub Pages, Jekyll and CloudCannon to build this blog.
            I was able to get everything configured and running in about two
            hours (this included reading and research time).
            I am now looking forward to tinkering with these new tools and
            learning how to use them.
