### Professional practice 26/9/16

My first lesson in professional practice was more interesting than I imagined. Our course was amalgamated with another doing construction and landscaping with students from China. I enjoyed working with them. Their level of English is quite respectful considering they haven't been in England long. I am always awe struck by anyone who can speak multiple languages. It really is a great skill to have. 

Surprisingly, Margaret Ross informed the class and myself that, after joining the British Computing Society  I can create a processional e-mail address with this domain name which would help me look more professional when writing a Curriculum Vitae. Needless to say the first thing I was doing after class was to set this up.
